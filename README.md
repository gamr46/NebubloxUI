**Universal Roblox Script Hub** by He Who Remains Lil'Nug

## 🚀 Quick Start

Execute this in your executor:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamr46/NebubloxUI/main/loader.lua"))()
```

The loader will:
1. **Auto-detect** the game you're in and load the correct script
2. **Show a menu** if the game isn't recognized, letting you pick manually
